# GA-TOPTW

The Team Orienteering Problem is a routing problem on a graph with durations associated to the arcs and profits assigned to visiting the vertices. This problem considers among NP-Hard problems and one of the favorite tools to solve them is metaheuristics. In this project I used Genetic Algorithm.
- Chromosome visualization 
- Selection operators
- Mutation and Crossover operators
